# Development notes

lastCommitHash=`sh scripts/tasks/get-last-commit-hash.sh` - I removed from the dev and build

- Change index.hbs (not index.html)
- Changes can be previewed locally by running `npm run dev` and `serve .` in
  seperate shells.
- A build script (`npm run build`) will automatically run after each commit and
  create another commit for the build.  You don't need to care about it. When
  you push the changes, your commits + build commit will be pushed.
